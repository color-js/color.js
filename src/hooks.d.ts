/**
 * This is for plugin authors.
 * If you're not interested in writing plugins for Color.js, you can skip this.
 *
 * Hooks afford extensibility far beyond what can be achieved
 * by overriding properties and methods, or using functions.
 * Hooks allow plugin authors to change how Color.jsâ€™ internal code works,
 * by adding custom callbacks to predefined points in the execution.
 *
 * You can find available hooks by searching the source code for `hooks.run(` in color.js.
 * If you need a hook that is not present, we typically accept pull requests for new hooks pretty easily!
 *
 * The Hooks module exports both a hooks object that is used throughout Color.js (as a default export),
 * as well as a Hooks class (as a named export) that can be used to create new sets of hooks.
