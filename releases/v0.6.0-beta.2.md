# v0.6.0-beta.2

## ⬇️ 90 million downloads!

Just a few days ago when we released v0.6.0-beta.1, Color.js had 80 million downloads.
We are now at 90 million downloads, and the rate of increase is still accelerating (currently at 3 million downloads **per week**).
In fact, we had to automate updating the number in our README so we could have a chance to keep up (thanks @MysteryBlokHed!)

As a reminder, we recently started an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/color) so you can fund Color.js's development.
If your company depends on Color.js in any way, it is in your best interest to ensure its future is sustainable.

## Changes from v0.6.0-beta.1

### Improvements to types

- Bump TypeScript to v5.5 and in type definitions, replace `@typedef` with `@import` where relevant to improve DX and overall quality of generated `.d.ts` files (by @MysteryBlokHed and @lloydk in #686)
