# v0.6.0-alpha.2

## ⬇️ 80 million downloads!

Color.js is quickly becoming the de facto color handling library for JS:
[it has now been downloaded over 80 million times on npm](https://limonte.dev/total-npm-downloads/?package=colorjs.io),
a number that is rapidly increasing, at the rate of nearly 3 million downloads **per week**!

As a reminder, we recently started an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/color) so you can fund Color.js's development.
If your company depends on Color.js in any way, it is in your best interest to ensure its future is sustainable.

## Changes

### API

- A common request has been a function that gracefully parses colors, without throwing if there is an error. This version adds exactly that: `tryColor()`/`Color.try()` (by @LeaVerou in #664)
- A common use case was to use the procedural API for tree-shaking and performance, but still import all color spaces that Color.js supports. This is now made much easier, through the new `spaces` export of `/fn` and the new `/spaces` top-level export. (by @LeaVerou in #663, with types by @MysteryBlokHed in #668)
- New `/src` export to import Color.js's source code directly (by @LeaVerou in #663, with types by @MysteryBlokHed in #668)

### For spec compliance

- Change `color(ictcp ...)` to `ictcp(...)` per CSS Color HDR (by @svgeesus in #646)
- Change `color(jzazbz ...)` to `jzazbz(...)`, and `color(jzczhz ...)` to `jzczhz(...)` per CSS Color HDR (by @svgeesus in #647)
- Unprefix `display-p3-linear` since it is now in CSS Color 4 (i.e. `color(--display-p3-linear ...)` → `color(display-p3-linear ...)` (by @svgeesus in c90fe38). Not a breaking change, as both are still supported.
- Use gamma 2.40 for display-referred `rec2020`; rename previous implementation as scene-referred `--rec2020-oetf` (by @svgeesus in #669)
- Make HSL parsing spec-compliant (by @kleinfreund in #650)

### Bug fixes

- CAM16 and HCT hues are now correctly set to `null` when chroma is near zero (by @facelessuser in #644)
- Fix issues with creating custom color spaces (by @sidewayss and @LeaVerou in #628)
- Don't clamp negative values in Absolute XYZ D65 (by @svgeesus in #613)
- Adjust calculations in Jzazbz and fix Jzazbz and JzCzhz reference ranges (by @svgeesus in #634 #635)
- Ensure Prophoto and Rec2020 spaces handle negative values (by @lloydk in #640)
- Don't throw for unknown coords when space accessors are used (by @LeaVerou)
- In `toGamut()`, better handle the case when JND equals 0 (by @facelessuser in #659)

### Improvements to types

- Overload `multiplyMatrices` types and update implementation to pass all tests (by @epsilonError in #580 #631)
- Fix CAM16 and HCT type errors (by @lloydk and @MysteryBlokHed in #622)
- Fix different types and type errors (by @lloydk in #642)
- Fix space accessor types to allow `null` (by @lloydk)
- Fix return types of the `darken()`/`lighten()` functions on the `Color` class (by @lloydk in #654)

### For contributors

- Testsuite & test coverage improvements (by @epsilonError in #594 and @svgeesus in f02ce7f)
